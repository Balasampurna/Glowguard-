# Glowguard-
GlowGuard – Smart Lighting Automation using Arduino  An energy-efficient smart lighting system that uses PIR and LDR sensors to automatically turn lights ON/OFF based on motion and ambient light. Designed for classrooms and hostels to reduce electricity waste and promote sustainability. Built with Arduino and real-time sensor integration.
# GlowGuard – Smart Lighting Automation 💡

An energy-saving smart lighting system using PIR and LDR sensors to automate lighting based on motion and ambient light.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- PIR Sensor
- LDR
- LED
- Resistor
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## ⚙️ How It Works
- If it’s dark *and* motion is detected → Light turns ON
- Else → Light stays OFF

## 💡 Why GlowGuard?
Helps reduce electricity usage in classrooms, hostels, and corridors by using sensor-based automation.
